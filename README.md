Werk SQuAD (Student Quasar Absorption Diagnosticians) is a collaboration of UW undergraduate student researchers led by Astronomy Professor Jessica Werk whose mission is to leave no absorption feature in z∼1 QSOs unidentified.

Their role has shifted somewhat after completeing the QSO sightlines fo CGMsquared. I have created some tools for them to analze the full CGMsquared data set.
