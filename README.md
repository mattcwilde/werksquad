Tools for the WerkSQuAD to analyze galaxy and quasar data

Werk SQuAD (Student Quasar Absorption Diagnosticians) is a collaboration of UW undergraduate student researchers led by Astronomy Professor Jessica Werk whose mission is to leave no absorption feature in zâˆ¼1 QSOs unidentified. 

(see https://www.werksquad.com/werk-squad-home)

Their role has shifted somewhat after completeing the QSO sightlines fo CGMsquared. I have created some tools for them to analze the full CGMsquared data set.
